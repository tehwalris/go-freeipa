# Unmaintained!!!

This project is unmaintained. [This fork](https://github.com/ccin2p3/go-freeipa) is actively maintained.

I no longer work with FreeIPA and can not justify
maintaining this project in my free time. Consider using one of the
[forks](https://github.com/tehwalris/go-freeipa/network), especially [ccin2p3/go-freeipa](https://github.com/ccin2p3/go-freeipa).

# go-freeipa

usage examples and more info. See
[`developing.md`](https://github.com/tehwalris/go-freeipa/blob/master/developing.md)
for information on how this library is generated.
